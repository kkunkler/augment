# augment
Framework written in SuperCollider for live algorithmic music generation.  Augment provides simplified signal routing and wraps patterns and synths in an interface to allow them to be interchanged and easily connected to hardware controllers.

Audio examples of previous work using Augment are at www.kylekunkler.com
